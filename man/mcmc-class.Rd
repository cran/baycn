\describe{
\item{\code{burnIn}}{The percentage of MCMC iterations that will be discarded from
the beginning of the chain.}

\item{\code{chain}}{A matrix where the rows contain the vector of edge states for the
accepted graph.}

\item{\code{decimal}}{A vector of decimal numbers. Each element in the vector is the
decimal of the accepted graph.}

\item{\code{iterations}}{The number of iterations for which the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm is run.}

\item{\code{posteriorES}}{A matrix of posterior probabilities for all three edge
states for each edge in the network.}

\item{\code{posteriorPM}}{A posterior probability adjacency matrix.}

\item{\code{likelihood}}{A vector of log likelihood values. Each element in the
vector is the log likelihood of the accepted graph.}

\item{\code{stepSize}}{The number of iterations discarded between each iteration that
is kept.}

\item{\code{time}}{The runtime of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in seconds.}
