#' mhEdge
#'
#' The main function for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It returns the
#' posterior distribution of the edge directions.
#'
#' @param data A matrix with the variables across the columns and the
#' observations down the rows. If there are genetic variants in the data these
#' variables must come before the remaining variables. If there are clinical
#' phenotypes in the data these variables must come after all other variables.
#' For example, if there is a data set with one genetic variant variable, three
#' gene expression variables, and one clinical phenotype variable the first
#' column in the data matrix must contain the genetic variant data, the next
#' three columns will contain the gene expression data, and the last column will
#' contain the clinical phenotype data.
#'
#' @param adjMatrix An adjacency matrix indicating the edges that will be
#' considered by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This can be the output from
#' another algorithm (e.g., PC). An adjacency matrix is a matrix of zeros and
#' ones. The ones represent an edge and its direction between two nodes.
#'
#' @param burnIn A number between 0 and 1 indicating the percentage of the
#' sample that will be discarded.
#'
#' @param iterations An integer for the number of iterations to run the MH
#' algorithm.
#'
#' @param nCPh The number of clinical phenotypes in the graph.
#'
#' @param nGV The number of genetic variants in the graph.
#'
#' @param pmr Logical. If true the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm will use the
#' Principle of Mendelian Randomization (PMR). This prevents the direction of an
#' edge pointing from a gene expression or a clinical phenotype node to a
#' genetic variant node.
#'
#' @param prior A vector containing the prior probability for the three edge
#' states.
#'
#' @param progress Logical. If TRUE a progress bar will be printed.
#'
#' @param thinTo An integer indicating the number of observations the chain
#' should be thinned to.
#'
#' @return An object of class baycn containing 9 elements:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item burnIn -- The percentage of MCMC iterations that will be discarded from
#' the beginning of the chain.
#'
#' \item chain -- A matrix where each row contains the vector of edge states for
#' the accepted graph.
#'
#' \item decimal -- A vector of decimal numbers. Each element in the vector is
#' the decimal of the accepted graph.
#'
#' \item iterations -- The number of iterations for which the
#' Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is run.
#'
#' \item posteriorES -- A matrix of posterior probabilities for all three edge
#' states for each edge in the network.
#'
#' \item posteriorPM -- A posterior probability adjacency matrix.
#'
#' \item likelihood -- A vector of log likelihood values. Each element in the
#' vector is the log likelihood of the accepted graph.
#'
#' \item stepSize -- The number of MCMC iterations discarded between each
#' accepted graph.
#'
#' \item time -- The runtime of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in seconds.
